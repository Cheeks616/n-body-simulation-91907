# n-body-simulation : 91907 and 91903

This is my n-body simulation for CSC 91907 and 91903.

I have created two scripts to document my process and learning process throughout the development of these simulations.

The first script (2D n-body) is a 2-dimensional n-body simulation written in python using PyCharm IDE. This uses matplotlib for the graphing design.

The second script (3D n-body) is a 3-dimensional n-body simulation written in python using PyCharm IDE. This uses modules such as matplotlib for the graphing design and some tkinter sliders.
