# n-body-simulation : 91907 and 91903

This is my n-body simulation for CSC 91907 and 91903.

I have created three scripts to demonstrate my development and learning process throught the creation of these simulations.

The first script (2D n-body) is a 2-dimensional n-body simulation written in python using PyCharm IDE. This uses matplotlib for the graphing design.

The second script (3D n-body) is a 3-dimensional n-body simulation written in python using PyCharm IDE. This uses modules such as matplotlib for the graphing design and some tkinter sliders.

The third and final script (Barnes-hut algorithm) is a large scale (n>10,000) n-body simulation written in C++ using Visual Studio IDE.
